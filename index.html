					<p class="main-article__paragraph">The Black Mountain is not just a volcano, but an important historical place, it was here that the story of the fall of the dwarves of Black Iron into the abyss of slavery of Ragnaros began. Later, orcs settled here, as far as we know, the Black Mountain reminded the eponymous clan of their native places. In the subsequent Second War, this place became the headquarters of the Horde forces, and at the end of the war, a decisive battle took place at the foot of the forces of Azeroth and the Horde troops, which had thinned considerably due to Gul'dan's betrayal.</p>
